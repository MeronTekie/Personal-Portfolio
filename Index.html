      <h4>About Me</h4>
      <p>
        I ,Meron G.Tekie , was born and raise in Eritrea,a tiny country by the
        horn of Africa.I grew up in Asmara a beautiful city that made my
        childhood memories unforgetable.After I graduated highschool I joined
        EIT(Eritrean Institute of Technology) to study Mechanical Engineering.
        After studying for four years there I moved to the U.S in 2016.After
        moving to Seattle my interest started growing and I decided to shift my
        career in the Information Technology field.As A result I joined
        Epicodous.I am so excited and can not wait to rock and roll.
